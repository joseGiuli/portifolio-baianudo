    "What has always attracted me to technology is the ability to solve real problems. In design, I found a way to listen attentively, understand contexts, and turn all of that into experiences that make people's lives easier.",
    "My professional career began in sales, where I had the opportunity to talk to clients, understand needs, and seek viable solutions. In that day-to-day, I learned, in practice, the value of empathy, and over time I realized how much the user experience can determine a product's success.",
    "Today I work as a UX/UI and Product Designer, creating digital experiences that make sense. I like to balance simplicity, functionality, beauty, and intention, focusing on translating real needs into clear and relevant solutions, always considering the user's context.",
    "I have experience with products for Android, iOS, and Web, as well as websites, landing pages, and complete flows. My process blends listening, collaboration, and attention to what truly matters."
